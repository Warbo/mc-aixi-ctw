/** The environment is a more elaborate version of Tiger. There are two doors
 * and a stool. A tiger is hidden behind one door and a pot of gold is hidden
 * behind the other. The agent begins each round sitting on the stool where it
 * may either listen for the tiger (ExtendedTiger::aListen) or stand up
 * (ExtendedTiger::aStand). Listening for the tiger results in an observation
 * which correctly describes the tiger's whereabouts with probability
 * ExtendedTiger::m_listen_accuracy and a reward of ExtendedTiger::rListen.
 * Standing up result in an uninformative observation (ExtendedTiger::oNull) and
 * a reward of ExtendedTiger::rStand. Once the agent is standing, it may open
 * either the left or right door (ExtendedTiger::oLeft and
 * ExtendedTiger::oRight). Doing so results in an uninformative observation
 * (ExtendedTiger::oNull) and a reward based on what is behind the door
 * (ExtendedTiger::rGold or ExtendedTiger::rTiger). After opening a door the
 * agent is re-seated and the tiger and gold randomly re-allocated to a door
 * (ExtendedTiger::reset()). Attempting to open a door while seated, to listen
 * while standing, or to stand while already standing will result in an
 * uninformative observation (ExtendedTiger::oNull) and a reward of
 * ExtendedTiger::rInvalid.
 *
 * Domain characteristics:
 * - environment: "extended-tiger"
 * - maximum action: 3 (2 bits)
 * - maximum observation: 2 (2 bits)
 * - maximum reward: 130 (8 bits)
 *
 * Configuration options:
 * - tiger-listen-accuracy (optional): probability that listening (while seated)
 *   will correctly locate the door which hides the tiger. Must be a floating
 *   point value between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive. Stored in
 *   ExtendedTiger::m_listen_accuracy. Default value is
 *   ExtendedTiger::cDefaultListenAccuracy. */
