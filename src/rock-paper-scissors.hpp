/** The agent repeatedly plays Rock-Paper-Scissor against an opponent that has
 * a slight, predictable bias in its strategy. If the opponent has won a round
 * by playing rock on the previous cycle, it will always play rock at the next
 * time step; otherwise it will pick an action uniformly at random. The agent's
 * observation is the most recently chosen action of the opponent. It receives
 * a reward of RockPaperScissors::rWin for a win, RockPaperScissors::rDraw for
 * a draw and RockPaperScissors::rLose for a loss.
 *
 * Domain characteristics:
 *  - environment: "rock-paper-scissors"
 *  - maximum action: 2 (2 bits)
 *  - maximum observation: 2 (2 bits)
 *  - maximum reward: 2 (2 bits) */
