# Maze environment
# * maze-num-rows: the number of rows in the maze
# * maze-num-cols: the number of columns in the maze
# * maze-rewards#: comma-separated list of rewards for each square in row #. If
#     the agent enters (or attempts to enter) a particular square it receives
#     the corresponding reward. 1 <= # <= maze-num-rows.
# * maze-layout#: The layout of row # of the maze (1 <= # <= maze-num-rows).
#                 Contains maze-num-cols symbols as follows:
#   * @: indicates the square cannot be entered (a.k.a. "a wall").
#   * *: indicates the square can be entered and teleported to.
#   * &: indicates the square can be entered but not teleported to.
#   * !: indicates the square can be entered, and that doing so will randomly
#        teleport the agent to a "*" square before the next turn (the agent
#        receives the reward of the "!" square i.e. before the teleportation
#        occurs).
# * maze-observation-encoding: Specifies the type of observations the agent recieves
#   * uninformative: the agent receives the same reward each cycle.
#   * walls: the agent receives an observation specifying whether there are
#            walls "@" above, below, left, or right of its current position.
#   * coordinates: the observation specifies the coordinates of the agent in
#                  the maze.
